Trent once found himself in the company of a group of soldiers. They were all veterans of war and soon they got to talking about their experiences on the battlefield. One old soldier told of the time he had single-handedly slain five enemy soldiers. Another gave a detailed description of the manner in which he had held an entire enemy battalion at bay. One of them looked condescendingly at Trent and said, "I don't suppose you have any adventure worth telling".
