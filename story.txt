Trent once found himself in the company of a group of soldiers. They were all veterans of war and soon they got to talking about their experiences on the battlefield. One old soldier told of the time he had single-handedly slain five enemy soldiers. Another gave a detailed description of the manner in which he had held an entire enemy battalion at bay. One of them looked condescendingly at Trent and said, "I don't suppose you have any adventure worth telling".

Rowan: Trent thought to himself, and one particular story came to mind. He had never been one to talk much, but they wanted a story. "I was fresh out of basic," he started. "All of us, you know my buddies and I were so desperate to be on the battle field back in the day." "I got deployed the second I was back from boot leave, and within a week of being put on base overseas, I found myself in the head on the front lines."
